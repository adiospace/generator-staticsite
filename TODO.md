# TODO

- customization (name of project, repo, etc)
- add missing data(repo, readme) to generated package.json (`_package.json`) 
- integrate bower
- nice theme for starter
- option for using compass and grunt-contrib-sass
- work at the layout (add mobile support and so on); maybe use http://html5boilerplate.com/
- maybe add svgmin task?
